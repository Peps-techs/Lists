    <p class="bordered"> This project is dedicated to promoting self-care and mindfulness through easy-to-use checklists and tools.
         My goal is to cultivate positive habits and maintain a balanced lifestyle. If I sent you this page, it's because I want to share where I am at and what I am working on.</p>
    <p>This site is a work in progress while I learn more about web development and have fun testing 
        things I come across while completing the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">Odin Project</a>.</p>
